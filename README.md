# Kravat

Data workflow scaffolding/programming in .net.

# Motivation

Programming websites/apis is often a repetitive process. Scaffolding and current flow programming (example: https://www.totaljs.com/flow/) offer two drastically different solutions. The goal of this framework is to provide a set of tools to visually scaffold an api. It goes beyond simple scaffolding by offering some of the elements that flow programming does. Stitching together service calls to produce a result in the generated file. As an example, [this configuration file](docs/kravatFormat.json) will produce two controllers. The UsersController and a [CompaniesController](docs/CompanyController.cs) with one configured endpoint.

The biggest driver behind this project is that I feel that workflow programming should allow a developer to trivially deviate from the code blocks that are given. The point of this project is not to create the blocks that are put together but to treat your services as those blocks. A great companion project to this might be a set of extremely common blocks, and a services / workflows section to add to your projects configuration json file.

# Configuration Format

The configuration file contains the configured models, the Endpoints (description of a url and what it does), the Workflows (a list of service methods to execute in order), and the Services (Configured Services/Methods that the Workflows use). [Here is an example](docs/kravatFormat.json).

# Feature Goals

-   [x] Allow the generation of the models json using a DLL containing an Entity Framework Context class.
-   [ ] Produce Controllers based on the configured models, services, and workflows. (Partially Complete, only allows one service in a workflow atm)
-   [ ] Create a visual editor to edit the Models, Endpoints, Services, and Workflows.
-   [ ] Create a command line tool that takes in a configuration file and a template file and produces a rendered file.
-   [ ] Create template files for javascript/typescript models and services.

# Notes

Currently the code is in a very 'proof of concept' state.
